# FaultFinder for DOS

A CA-Clipper application that provides a TV and VCR fault diagnosis.

The application is preserved here for nostalga rather than use.

* Video Cassette Recorders have gone the way of the Dodo
* TV's are no longer repaired but replaced.

The app has been reengineered to work with the open source implementation
of Clipper called Harbour.
